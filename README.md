# optimal_transport
In this exercise I used both supervised and unsupervised clustering techniques to identify groups of users most likely to adopt public transport.  

The repo is comprised of three files:
  - this readme file
  - the final presentation I created to present my results (commute_pres.pdf)
  - the python notebook I used to generate the graphs and clusters

The data was downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census1990-mld/ (the relevant file is 'USCensus1990.data.txt')
